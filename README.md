🧊✨ Three.js Rotating Cube  A simple practice demo built while learning Three.js. This project includes a scene, camera, geometry, material, lighting, and a smoothly rotating cube. Created as part of my 3D fundamentals journey 🚀🎨

<h1>Added texture to cube </h1>
<p>This project demonstrates a 3D rotating cube built using Three.js 🎥✨.
A high-quality texture is loaded onto the cube 🧱, the scene is rendered with a camera 🎯, and smooth real-time animation is created using the requestAnimationFrame() loop 🔄.
Perfect for beginners learning geometry, materials, textures, and rendering in Three.js 🚀.</p>
